# Password-Generator

<a href="https://pennyquirino.github.io/Password-Generator/">Click to see my work</a> 

This project was to creat an application for a user to generate a random password with minimum character length of 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. 

This application will run in a browser, will feature dynamic HTML and CSS with JavaScript. This must include special characters. 

I made my generator to have the required minimum characters of 8 and I chose a maximum of 25 characters. This was solely based off of thinking real life, rarely does someone have a password above 25 characters. 

I gave it the full alphabet both upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. I went with a slider to make it a little more interactive and it seemed more fun to have as well. 

When boxes are checked, it will generate a password using the boxes checked in addition to the default of lowercase.

The homework should not produce any errors in the console when you inspect it using Chrome DevTools.
